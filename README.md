# Swachh Survekshan Scoring Platform

> The main idea for the project was to ease out the current procedure of voting scores scores to cities in Swachhta Survekshan.
> Currently the procedure followed is we dial a toll free number and we here a voice that narrates the question, and we have to press buttons corresponding to what score we want to give.
> So, we wanted to convert this into a web interface. The advantage of doing so was also that many more questions could be included in the questionnaire.
> We created forms and mapped each option with it's score. One additional  feature that we implemented was showing live ranking of the cities.
> The technology used were JSP and Servlet.
